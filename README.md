# python-challenge

Task:
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.

Run down:
I used python to do the following:

(Py Bank):
Import, open csv files(election & budget data)

The total number of months included in the dataset

The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

(Py Poll):
The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won
